        This tool is supposed is supposed to be very minimal way to play local
        and network files on Kodi. I made this little tool because how annoying
        it can be sometimes to play your local media. If you believe your idea
        could comply with this and be interesting at the same time, please `open
        an issue <https://github.com/ritiek/play-on-kodi/issues>`__ or send a
        PR!
